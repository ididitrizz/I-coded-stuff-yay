This is a blackjack game coded in the Python engine.
It should work in the 3.14.2 version.

RULES:

Attempt to get as high of a hand value as possible without going over 21.

J, Q and K are worth 10.

Number cards are worth their value.

A is worth either 11 or 1, the game will adjust this automatically.

Getting 21 with two cards is worth more than getting 21 with more cards.

Try to beat the dealer; dealer wins on a tie.



That's pretty much it, have fun!
